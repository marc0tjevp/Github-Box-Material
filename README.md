## Description
This version of github-repos works with MaterializeCSS. I'm planning on using it for my portfolio.

## Usage
Include github-repos.js, github-repos.css and MaterializeCSS in the page you want to display a GitHub-Box.

Display a box
	<a href="//github.com/marc0tjevp/United-GTK">United GTK</a>

You can link boxes to a class or id by using
	  <script>
	  	GHRepos.create('.projects a')
	  </script>
